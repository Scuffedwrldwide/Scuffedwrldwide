# Hey 👋 I'm Fernandes

### About me: 
<p>Currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at IST in Lisbon.</p>
<p>I'm constantly looking for ways to combine my drive for Software Engineering with my passion for arts and creativity.</p>
<p>If I'm not studying, you will certainly find me drawing, writing, getting better at the guitar, racing pretend cars in the simulator or real karts at the track 🏎️💨</p>
<p></p>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **an untitled Vampire visual novel, set in Lisbon!**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Java, C++ and the guitar**
